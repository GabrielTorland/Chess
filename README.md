# Chess

## Why I decided to create a chess in pygame
------------
After completing my first year of studying computer science, I was eager to start working on my own projects. My professor suggested using pygame, a popular library for creating games in Python. I thought it would be a great way to improve my Python skills and have some fun at the same time. I decided to develop a chess game, as I am a fan of the game and I wanted to challenge myself. I also had an idea to create a chess bot using machine learning in the future.

## details
------------
- Please keep in mind that I only had one year of experience when I developed this game.
- When you click on a chess piece, the possible moves are shown.
- The game only has two-player mode.
- Sound effects are implemented.
- The game has a visually appealing menu :smile:
- Pygame

## requirements
------------
- Use the requirements.txt file to download the required packages.

I hope you enjoy the game!
