# chess

INTRODUCTION
------------
After my first year of studying computer science, I was excited to start developing. My professor recommended the class to try pygame; as it would help us improve our python skills. Pygame is usualy used to develop games, so I decided to develop chess. Chess is something that I allways found interesting and I was excited to try creating a chess-AI afterward.

The game is developed in pygame which is a game engine in python.
