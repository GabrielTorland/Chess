# chess

INTRODUCTION
------------
After my first year of studying computer engineering, I was excited to develop something. Chess is something that I always found fun, which made it a pretty easy choice. 
The game is developed in pygame which is a game engine in python.

DETAILS 
------------
- Keep in mind that I only had 1 year of experience when I developed this game. I did not use venv, therefore it may stop working in the future.
- When clicking a chess piece, the possible moves is shown.
- There is only two player mode.
- Soundeffects are implemented.
- Good looking game menu.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- pygame installed: pip install pygame
- python

Enjoy!
